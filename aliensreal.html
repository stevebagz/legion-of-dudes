    After thousands of years of speculation aliens are finally confirmed to be real, everything has
    changed, but is it for the better? First what we know for sure, America has been working with alien
    craft for decades, entertainment has been preparing us for full disclosure and not all aliens are 
    the same species. Think Men in Black but on a smaller (maybe bigger - Editors note) scale.

    How do we know it? For decades people have had testimonies of being abducted, finding IMPOSSIBLE TO 
    RECREATE crop circles, animal mutilations, big groups all seeing the same giant flying crafts above 
    their cities, lies about balloons and swamp gas, ancient paintings with flying objects randomly 
    inserted, ex government officials claiming they saw them, amazing drawings in mountains, reported 
    bodies in Peru and many more amazing, undeniable things. Now we have actual government 
    whistleblowers blowing their whistles. David Grusch has all but confirmed aliens are real. (He calls
    them Non Human Intelligence, but we know he means aliens. - editors note)

    Grusch helped create a way for whistleblowers to come forward with information on UAPs with the 
    American congress. (He calls them UAPS but we know he really means UFOs - editors note). He then 
    reported to congress his findings and has 40 very credible witnesses.   He says that they create 
    and send unmanned drones from the ocean and they monitor the Earth, they are currently most 
    interested in Nuclear weapons and other conflicts. Reports go back to the Foo Fighters seen during 
    World War 2, they were UFOs seen by Allied fighter pilots in the sky. He says they don’t come from 
    far away but use inter-dimensional travel, similar to travelling back and forth from the dark 
    universe in Star Trek. He did not say if we are the dark universe or not.

    <br><br>
    Recently in Mexico some alien bodies have been presented that were found in Peru. The people who 
    have examined them are saying they are non human. Around were found but there are still some 
    sceptics, I am not sure of how real they are. It may be a hoax to undermine the current 
    disclosures. I just didn’t want to leave anything out.

    Where do the aliens come from? Some come from far distant galaxies most likely and others come from 
    other dimensions similar to above. Maybe its more like the Marvel multiverse, I am not sure how 
    many dimensions there are at this time. I barely understand this one with all of this new 
    information. They have been coming here for at least thousands of years and have under ocean bases 
    where they create their drones. This is why most sightings are near the coast.

    So now what? I think we just keep on living until the words really out. Some reports say they feed 
    on our emotion and they don’t like our love, so maybe try and be nice to each other. Look for hints
     in media, I think the stories where the aliens are harmed by water, think Signs and War of the 
     Worlds, are there to throw us off their trail. Movies like Men in Black to make us think its 
     ridiculous, movies like Aliens to make us think they are mindless monsters.  Star Trek gave us a 
     good idea of what we should hope for, and Gene Rodenberry was a revolutionary for his vision. Its 
     a slow ride to the truth, but it seems like we are very close to finding it all out.
