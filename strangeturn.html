        It was the early 90s.  My age could still be counted on one hand. I spent many days outside, playing in the yard,
        often by myself, limited only by my imagination.  No complex emotions,
        bills, commitments, or finances.  Just a young fellow made up of innocence and joy.
        <br><br>
        One particular day, I'd decided that it was a perfect occasion to test my own bravery, 
        and jump off the concrete steps at the back of my house.  I can still remember the pale 
        blue paint used on them, and how it flaked off as time gradually deteriorated them.  This 
        test of bravery mustn't be performed hastily or without style, so I decided it would add an 
        element of suspense if I started by jumping off the lowest step (easy), and making my way up to
        the very top of the concrete stairs.
        <br><br>
        The first four stairs were a breeze.  I leapt from them with a supreme level of confidence, my dirty sneakers
        slapping the ground on impact.  Today, that would be cause for a double knee surgery.  But I was invincible then.  The fifth stair
        was pretty scary, and it took a few moments to gather the courage needed to take the plunge.  Now, only one stair was left to 
        jump from.  One tier left to establish me as the record holder for stair jumps in my back yard.  But it wasn't so cut and dry. 
        We had a problem on our hands.

        I had to poop so bad.  As a non-child, you can relate to this feeling if you've ever had that first sip of coffee in the morning,
        and are suddenly ambushed by a poop pain.  Where did it come from?  Why was there no warning, no onset?  The Shit-O-Meter went from
        a flat 0 to critical in what seemed to be the blink of an eye.  You know the old saying about life giving you lemons, though.  I decided
        to use this discomfort as motivation to not dilly dally, and make that last jump.  Yes, this oncoming poop was the push (no
        pun intended) I needed to accomplish this incredible stunt.  I climbed to the top stair, clenching my anus, taking a deep breath, and 
        making the leap of faith.
        <br><br>
        From a technical standpoint, the stair jump was a screeching success.  From a not-shitting-my-pants standpoint, the same cannot be said.  
        Picture my small body as a container for this turd, which was very anxious to see daylight.  As we traveled together, accelerating
        via gravity in unison, my sneakers abruptly slapped the ground, stopping my body instantly.  It was as if the turd chose not to stop, and 
        continued accelerating at 9.8m/sÂ².  Maybe I had loose undies on that day, it's a bit blurry now, but I can tell you that the turd also chose
        to exit my underwear, and was stopped in its path only by the tight elastics of my jogging pants just above my ankles.  Now there's a real issue -
        I'm standing in my backyard with a full log bouncing around my ankle, and at this point I'm visibly upset.  <i>I know better than to shit myself.</i>
        But somehow, I managed to make it happen anyway.

        <i>A re-creation of my shame from failing to shit in a toilet</i>
        <br><br><br>
        I made my way up the stairs, in the house, and up another flight of stairs to the main bathroom, where I found myself sobbing uncontrollably, pulling
        open the elastic at the bottom of my jogging pants to let this turd loose into the toilet bowl so it can finally go home to its family.  There was poop in my
        underwear, down my legs, and definitely all over my pants.  All because I needed to prove how brave I was, and how fast I could get the job done.  Let
        this be a lesson to anyone reading.  A wise co-worker I had once said, "Don't fuck with your asshole".  And I totally get it.  Hopefully you do too.
