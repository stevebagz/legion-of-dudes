        <p>Welcome to Legion of Dudes!  And what are <i>you</i> doing here?  You really hit the lottery by stumbling into this place.  
            Our only feature is our staff, who enjoy rambling on the internet the good old fashioned way:  On a stupid ass website.  
            Where's the app anyway?

        <p>Since you decided to show up, you can browse around our various items of interest at the top of the page.  If you're 
            into 80s/90s/00s nostalgia, insane rambling, or video games, you'll find something here to help you throw away a 
            microscopic portion of your life.  Enjoy!
